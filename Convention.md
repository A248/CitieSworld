### Call Court Discussions

At any time, for any reason, a player with this permission may call a Court Discussion to clarify some legal status, principle, or precedent. The discussion will revolve around a question â€“ with the Court to give the final binding answer.

Once a Court Discussion is called, the Court will be summoned. Players may either argue for an answer or remain a judge. Should they decide to argue for or against an answer, they cannot participate in deciding the final binding answer. Should the player remain a judge, they cannot argue for or against an answer. Merely, judges can question the players who are arguing to clarify their argument(s). If no players decide to argue, then the Court Discussion will be closed. It is possible to have one player argue for one answer.

Finally, after 3 weeks of deliberation, the Court should start to come to a decision. The judges cannot reach and decide a majority decision before 3 weeks of the beginning of the Court Discussion. The majority of judges must agree on the final answer for it to become the final binding answer.

If the judges do not reach a majority decision within 6 weeks of the beginning of the Court Discussion, then the Court Discussion will be closed and no final binding answer will be issued. If the judges reach a majority decision within 6 weeks of the beginning of the Court Discussion, but not before 3 weeks of the beginning of the Court Discussion, the answer they have decided upon will be issued as a final binding answer, upheld as law.
