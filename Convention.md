## Specific Privileges

### Simple Rights

Players with this permission may:
 * Use /fly or other means of flying at one's leisure.
 * Craft a custom map from a shapeless recipe of a sign, a lapis block, and another lapis block. One crafted, an image may be pasted onto such a custom map item via a custom command, provided the image is formatted correctly such that it may be replicated on a map.
 * Will have access to a feature which may be used to name an entity, provided they have the landlord's permission and the action of naming does not prevent the mob from despawning.
 * May craft 4 packed ice from a shapeless recipe of 4 ice.
 * "Breed" villagers by rightclicking a villager while holding 2 or more carrots. If there is a second villager close to the first one, then a new villager will be spawned at the clicked villager.
 * Resummon the enderdragon with /summon EnderDragon, with a maximum amount of 1 Enderdragon in the world at a time.

Each player may only create a maximum of 2,000 custom maps.

### Basic Legal Rights

Players with this permission have:
 * The right to freedom of speech.
 * The right to due process and a fair trial.
 * The right to not incriminate oneself.
 
### PvP Rights

Players with this permission must be notified and allowed to leave the property, should the landlord suddenly allow pvp for them.

### Combat-Logging and Quitting

Combat logging is legal. One may leave the game, teleport or fly at any time.

### File lawsuits

Players with this permission may file a lawsuit, initiating a Court trial:
 * Whether an action is accidental or purposeful will be decided in a court of law.
 * A majority (>50%) of the Court must find someone guilty to convict that person. Any prosecutors and any defendants do not count as “the Court” during trials involving them.
 * If 50% or less of the Court finds the defendant guilty, the prosecutor may not be fined for false charges. Else, the Court may decide the fine.
 * Prosecutors may only explicitly prosecute for actions not older than six months. 

### Vote on Difficulty

Players with this permission, when online, may participate in difficulty votes:
 * Changing the worldwide difficulty to a harder difficulty must be unanimously agreed upon.
 * Else, if the difficulty is not agreed upon, the easiest difficulty proposed is used worldwide.
 * Any player may set the difficulty to peaceful at any time.

### Vote on Time

Players with this permission, when online, may participate in time votes:
 * Unanimous agreement is required to change the world time.

### Claiming and Land Ownership

Players with this permission must obtain approval by 50% of the Court to claim land. 50% of the Court must agree to certify a claim of land.

75% of the Court is needed to reject a claim after its certification.

The landlord of a river may prohibit someone from trespassing, or fishing, and may build canals and/or dams. Canals may be claimed anywhere. Rivers include normal rivers and frozen rivers.

On claimed land one may edit blocks as the landlord wishes.

All claims made before the creation of the Convention are automatically verified. 

Two players can jointly operate a claim. In this case, the consensus of both players is required to prohibit trespassing, evict inhabitants of the claim, or impose any other restriction on movement. A joint claim requires 75% of the Court to ratify.

### PvP and Movement Control

A landlord may prohibit trespassing on certain blocks. A landlord may kick players from their territory, or impose a tax on entrance.
The landlord of territory may at any time evict any enterer, by force if necessary, but must give a warning before using force.

The landlord reserves full rights to allow or deny pvp for any players with any other players or mobs on his/her land. Landlords grant permission for mob killing.

### Enderman and TnT Protection

Players with this permission may:
* Use the enderman-grief WorldGuard flag in their own land to prevent endermen from placing/picking up blocks, such that enderman can no longer edit blocks in the way that endermen normally do in vanilla conditions.
* Utilize forms of programmed TNT protection to restrict the usage of TNT in their own land and deny TNT-wielding players the opportunity to grief. TNT protection may only affect a landlord’s own claimed land.
* Optionally disable/enable creepers from damaging blocks on their own claimed land through explosive power.

### Request Backups

Players with this permission may request backups:
 * When a backup is requested, whichever player is responsible for the hosting (i.e., digital storage) of the world, known as the backup creator, must create a backup of the world and share it with the requesting player.
 * If the requesting player claims the backup has not been shared, the backup creator must share it over Google Drive.

### Nether Claims

Players with this permission may claim in the nether. Nether claims must specify y-levels. 

If a nether claim fails ratification, it may be proposed as a pass-through claim, in which case players must be able to pass through from any x or z direction. Thus the landlord can choose either layout:
*SEE FILE images/nether_claims_passthrough.png*
(where the lines represent passages at least one block wide to pass through) or any layout approved (on a case-by-case basis) by a majority of the Court.

### Call Court Discussions

Players with this permission may, at any time, for any reason, call a Court Discussion to clarify some legal status, principle, or precedent. The discussion will revolve around a question – with the Court to give the final binding answer.

Once a Court Discussion is called, the Court will be summoned. Players may either argue for an answer or remain a judge. Should they decide to argue for or against an answer, they cannot participate in deciding the final binding answer. Should the player remain a judge, they cannot argue for or against an answer. Merely, judges can question the players who are arguing to clarify their argument(s). If no players decide to argue, then the Court Discussion will be closed. It is possible to have one player argue for one answer.

Finally, after 3 weeks of deliberation, the Court should start to come to a decision. The judges cannot reach and decide a majority decision before 3 weeks of the beginning of the Court Discussion. The majority of judges must agree on the final answer for it to become the final binding answer.

If the judges do not reach a majority decision within 6 weeks of the beginning of the Court Discussion, then the Court Discussion will be closed and no final binding answer will be issued. If the judges reach a majority decision within 6 weeks of the beginning of the Court Discussion, but not before 3 weeks of the beginning of the Court Discussion, the answer they have decided upon will be issued as a final binding answer, upheld as law.

### Unlimited AFK

Players with this permission:
 * Are allowed to be afk (away from keyboard) or seemingly inactive in the world without being kicked out.
 * Cannot be kicked unless by an anticheat. 

### Replace Blocks Automatically

Players with this permission can use the command /citiesreplace to replace blocks in an area. They will receive all old blocks replaced but will have to pay for all new blocks inserted. If the player cannot pay for the new blocks, the command will stop.

## Specific Restrictions

### Property Rights Violations

Players with this restriction may not:
 * Use flint and steel, lava, or TNT on unclaimed land, nor may one let the fire, lava, or TNT explosion(s) leak onto unclaimed land purposefully.
 * Purposefully let fire, lava or TNT explosion(s) leak onto claimed land without the landlord’s permission.

### Destruction of Nature

Players with this restriction may not:
 * Grief/destroy vast amounts of unclaimed land en masse.
 * Kill Villagers
 
### Claiming Restrictions

Prospective landlords may only claim blocks of a river that are 
either
- nested within other claims
or
- dried up, i.e. above water and solid

Rivers as boundaries may not be claimed. 

For ocean biome claims, including those of deep oceans or frozen oceans, 75% of the Court is required to approve the claim, and the claim must be developed.

If an unverified claim encompasses at least ⅓ of another claimed territory, the claim is an encompassing claim and requires ¾ verification of the Court.
All encompassing claims are rejected upon the creation of this resolution, but may be re-verified.
 
### Structure Restrictions

Players with this restriction may not:
 * Block access to strongholds and nether fortresses.

Nether fortresses: the second-closest nether fortress will be preserved; the others may be harvested or destroyed, beyond the other rules for unclaimed land.
Strongholds: the second-closest stronghold will be preserved; the others may be harvested or destroyed, beyond the other rules for unclaimed land.

The contents of dungeons and mineshafts, more specifically the blocks comprising the structures themselves, belong to the player who discovers them.

Strongholds and nether fortresses may not be claimed. Players are free to claim ocean monuments, dungeons, mineshafts, villages, jungle temples, and desert temples.

### TnT

Players with this restriction may not craft, pickup, acquire, use, place, ignite, or transport TnT, TnT minecarts, or any sort of explosive mechanisms.

### Universal Restrictions

One may not break the Convention.

The mods allowed on the official Arim list are allowed in the world, and those not allowed in the Arim list, not allowed in the world.
